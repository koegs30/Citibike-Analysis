# Citi Bike Analysis

The objective for this project was to find two "phenomena" in the publicly available Citibike data (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

My Tableau file can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/katherine.sullivan#!/

Please note I have two stories within the tableau file as well as several dashboards and charts.  One story addresses an anomaly with regards the the birth year of renters and the other a look at the type of trip (roundtrip vs end-to-end) and related conclusions.

Stories:
1) Customer Input Birth Year Issue
2) Types of Rentals: Roundtrips and Trips Over 24 Hours
