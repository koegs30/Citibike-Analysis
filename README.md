# tableau-homework

Included here is the Jupyter file I used to pull data together from several CSVs.  In truth I pulled data similarly several times with a couple of different Jupyter Notebooks.  I ended up usin the file included in this respository of the stories that I could pull from the combined dataset.

My Tableau file can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/katherine.sullivan#!/

Please note I have two stories within the tableau file as well as several dashboards and charts.
Stories:
1) Customer Input Birth Year Issue
2) Types of Rentals: Roundtrips and Trips Over 24 Hours
